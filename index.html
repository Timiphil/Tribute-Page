   She was initially hesitant to endorse the notion of her husband running for president because she was worried about how the campaign would affect their young girls. Despite her initial reservations, she ended up becoming a successful campaign surrogate for him. She decided to promote a number of causes when her husband was elected, including helping military families and promoting healthy eating to combat the pandemic of childhood obesity.

   Michelle Obama established herself as a role model for many Americans as a young mother, a fashion queen, and the first First Lady of African Americans. Michelle co-founded the Joining Forces program in 2011 with the goal of increasing the educational and job opportunities
