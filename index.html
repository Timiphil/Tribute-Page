   Michelle LaVaughn Robinson Obama[1] (born January 17, 1964) is an American attorney and author who served as first
   lady of the United States from 2009 to 2017. She was the first African-American woman to serve in this position. She
   is married to former President Barack Obama. An Ivy League graduate <a
    href="https://www.history.com/topics/first-ladies/michelle-obama" id="tribute-link" target="_blank">she built a
    successful career</a>, first as a lawyer, and then in the private sector, which she maintained throughout her
   husbandâ€™s early political career. Michelle was initially hesitant to endorse the notion of her husband running for president because she was worried about
   how the campaign would affect their young girls. Despite her initial reservations, she ended up becoming a successful
   campaign surrogate for him. She decided to promote a number of causes when her husband was elected, including helping
   military families and promoting healthy eating to combat the pandemic of childhood obesity. Michelle Obama established
   herself as a role model for many Americans as a young mother, a fashion queen, and the first First Lady of African
   Americans.
